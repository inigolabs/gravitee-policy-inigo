= Gravitee Inigo GraphQL Security Policy

== Description

The Inigo GraphQL Security Policy provides comprehensive security, observability, and governance for GraphQL APIs. This policy integrates with the Inigo platform to deliver:

* **Query Analysis & Validation**: Deep inspection of GraphQL queries for malicious patterns
* **Rate Limiting**: Advanced rate limiting based on query complexity and depth
* **Schema Governance**: Enforce schema policies and breaking change detection  
* **Security Protection**: Protection against common GraphQL attacks (DoS, introspection abuse, etc.)
* **Observability**: Detailed metrics, tracing, and analytics for GraphQL operations
* **Federation Support**: Full support for GraphQL Federation and subgraph services

The policy processes incoming GraphQL requests through the Inigo security engine before they reach your GraphQL backend, ensuring only safe and compliant queries are executed.

NOTE: This policy requires APIM 4.0.0 or later and an active Inigo service token from https://app.inigo.io

== Setup

1. **Get Inigo Token**: Sign up at https://app.inigo.io and generate a service token
2. **Prepare Schema**: Have your GraphQL schema ready in SDL format (optional but recommended)
3. **Configure Policy**: Add the policy to your API with the required token
4. **Test**: Send GraphQL queries through your Gravitee gateway
